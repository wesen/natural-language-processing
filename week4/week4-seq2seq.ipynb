    "# Learn to calculate with seq2seq model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will learn how to use neural networks to solve sequence-to-sequence prediction tasks. Seq2Seq models are very popular these days because they achieve great results in Machine Translation, Text Summarization, Conversational Modeling and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using sequence-to-sequence modeling you are going to build a calculator for evaluating arithmetic expressions, by taking an equation as an input to the neural network and producing an answer as it's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting solution for this problem will be based on state-of-the-art approaches for sequence-to-sequence learning and you should be able to easily adapt it to solve other tasks. However, if you want to train your own machine translation system or intellectual chat bot, it would be useful to have access to compute resources like GPU, and be patient, because training of such systems is usually time consuming. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task you will need the following libraries:\n",
    " - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) — an open-source software library for Machine Intelligence.\n",
    " - [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) — a tool for data mining and data analysis.\n",
    " \n",
    "If you have never worked with TensorFlow, you will probably want to read some tutorials during your work on this assignment, e.g. [Neural Machine Translation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/seq2seq) tutorial deals with very similar task and can explain some concepts to you. "

However, in other tasks, the basic unit is often a word, and in this case the mapping would be *word $\\to$ integer*. The number of words might be huge, so it would be reasonable to filter them, for example, by frequency and leave only the frequent ones. Other strategies that your should consider are: data normalization (lowercasing, tokenization, how to consider punctuation marks), separate vocabulary for input and for output (e.g. for machine translation), some specifics of the task."

So far, we do not need them to make our calculator work, but this would be a necessary ingredient for more advanced tasks. \n",

Because of this difference (*training* vs *inference*), we will create two distinct instances, which will serve for the described scenarios.\n",
